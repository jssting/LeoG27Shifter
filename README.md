# LeoG27Shifter
Mod to use a Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro to host a controller for the g27 Shifter. The pinout config is shown in the attached diagram. 
You will also need to add the Joystick library from Matthew Heironimus (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) to compile and write it to the ProMicro or Leonardo board.

In addition to this you would need:
1. Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro 5v 16mhz
2. a small breadboard to place it on if you don't want to solder the cables onto the board directly 
3. a small enclosure to host the converter in (recommended)
4. a DB9 Male Connector and a 9 cable line ribbon cable(only 8 lines are used though) . which you can purchase at electronics stores or you can harvest it from an old external serial port( I had one lying around)
