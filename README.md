# LeoG27Shifter
Mod to use a Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro to host a controller for the g27 Shifter. The pinout config is shown in the attached diagram. 
You will also need to add the Joystick library from Matthew Heironimus (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) to compile and write it to the ProMicro or Leonardo board.
